# sazparser
A simple parser for Session Archive Zip (SAZ) files

Written based on http://fiddler.wikidot.com/saz-files 

The purpose is to analysis the result of fiddler (http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) with script.

Current implementation is very basic, but can already extract the most useful data for further analysis.
